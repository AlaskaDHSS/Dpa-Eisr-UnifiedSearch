## Editor

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the recommended editor for new development.

There are some worthwhile extensions for this project:

- C# - Code highlighting, formatting, intellisense, go-to-definition, and more
- Docker - Code highlighting, linting, and more for Docker and Docker Compose
- Markdown All in One - Markdown support and utilities
- ESLint - Show JavaScript linting errors in the editor
- EditorConfig - Keep syntax and formatting consistent for everyone
